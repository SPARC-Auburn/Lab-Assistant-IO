## Contributing

For those who would like to help in growing this repository, here are some guidelines on how to get started.

### 1. Where do I go from here?

The greatest way to help out with  the project and learn a little about it yourself is bug testing. 
If you've never really coded before, this may be a decent place to start.
If you believe you have a found bug or have a question, see if someone else has already created an issue in the tab above-
if not, go ahead and [create an issue](https://github.com/SPARC-Auburn/Lab-Assistant/issues/new).

### 2. Fork & create a branch

If the issue is something you think you can fix, create a fork of your own and a branch with a name
describing the problem. Then create a pull request to the main branch. This will allow you to work on the code
without changing the primary files

A good branch name would be (where issue #7 is the ticket you're working on):

```
Issue #7 - Slow Response times
```

The issue name for this would be "Slow Response Times"

### 3. Clone the files to your working environment and run

In order to start testing, download the repository. The best testing environment is a Linux distribution, and the Assistant can currently
be run by running the command

```
python Listen.py
```

In the terminal window while under the "PCKaren" directory.


### 4. Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by [searching all
  issues](https://github.com/SPARC-Auburn/Lab-Assistant/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new
  one](https://github.com/SPARC-Auburn/Lab-Assistant/issues/new).  Be sure to
  include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as
  possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating
  the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.
  Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .py file, make the
  necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the
  issue description**.
  
### 5. Do you want to help development?

 * Currently, the best way to help with development is to look into the **projects tab**. This keeps track of the current roadmap
 for Lab-Assistant, and are the features that are intended to be rolled out.
 * Once you have your own fork to work on, take a look at the different versions under [Projects](https://github.com/SPARC-Auburn/Lab-Assistant/projects).
 * Each version should have a feature that is either planned, under development, or finished. Find a feature you'd like to work on and
 submit a pull request for us to take a look at!

### 5. Implement your fix or feature

If you have a fix or feature you'd like to add, feel free to change it at this point on your own fork!
This is your testing environment, so don't worry about breaking it- that helps you learn!
If your program becomes irreparable, you can always clone or download it again.

### 6. Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should ensure that your branch is up to date with the most current master branch of Lab-Assistant.
Doing this will ensure that the feature or fix you have written will work with the current version.
Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!

Finally, go to GitHub and
[make a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)!

The retainers of this repository will run your code through a few tests to ensure that it is working correctly and 
will added it to the master branch as soon as it's been verified and is beneficial to what is being done.

We really appreciate all your help!
